Overview<br>
Hey there , in this project I made a simple weather application with decent frontend design using open-weather's landing page as api and "axios" as HTTP library to request third party server (ie open-weather) to fetch the weather data.
<br>
Working :-
<br>
User's just need to enter the city/country name to get today's weather information(ie temperature atmospheric parameters etc)of that particular place.
<br>
If the name of the city/country is valid and is present in the database the the above information is returned otherwise an error is returned.
<br>
Further I will be adding parameters like AQI , precipitation , chances of rain etc to increase the user experience.
